Appendix S7. Density distribution of centroids of geographically restricted alleles for
the fungal (F) and the algal (A) symbionts of Lobaria pulmonaria. The latitudinal and
longitudinal densities of the centroids in Europe are represented by the height of
centroid peaks to the left and at the bottom of the map. Rectangles indicate hotspot
regions of centroid density. Density distribution for the fungal symbiont was
calculated without the locus LPu09. The bar plot at the bottom gives the number of
alleles per locus (fungus: LPu15 to MS4; alga: LPh1 to LPh7) restricted to the region
enclosed by the respective rectangles.
