Define general meaning of microsatellites (i.e. microsats) --> specific meaning in Dal Grande et al. (2012) [not finished]

General definition: 
Microsats are simple sequence tandem repeats (SSTRs). The repeat units are generally di-, tri-, tetra- or pentanucleotides. A common 
repeat motif in birds is ACn, where the two nucleotides A and C are repated in bead-like fashion a variable number of times (n could range
from 8 to 50). On each side of the repeat unit are flanking regions that consist of "unordered" DNA. The flanking regions are critical, 
because they allow us to develop locus-specific primers to amplify the microsats with PCR (polymerase chain reaction). That is, given a
stretch of unordered DNA 50 base pair (bp) long, the probability of finding that particular stretch more than once in the genome is 0.25^50. In contrast, 
a given repeat unit (AC19) may occur in 1000s of places in the genome. We can use this combination of widely occurring repeat units and 
locus-specific flanking regions to find and develop microsat primers. The primers for PCR will be sequences from these unique flanking regions.
By having a forward and reverse primer on each side of the microsat, we can amplify a short (100-500 bp) locus-specific microsatellite region (Adapted from:

Mutation process: Microsats are useful genetic markers, because they tend to be highly polymorphic or variable. Mutation occurs very differently
from that of "classical" point mutations (i.e. substitute one nucleotide for another; G -> C). The mutation process occurs via slippage replication 
(for more info see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite). 

Definition of terms: 
*Locus (plural: loci): A locus in genetics is the position on a chromosome. Each chromosome carries many genes. Gene mapping is the process 
determining the locus for a particular biological trait. 
*PCR (polymerase chain reaction): is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA
across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. 
*Nucleotide: is one of the structural components, or building blocks of DNA & RNA. A nucleotide consists of a base (1 of 4 chemicals: 
adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) plus a molecule of sugar and one of phosphoric acid. 
*Primer: A primer is a short strand of RNA or DNA (generally 18-22 bases) that serves as a starting point for DNA synthesis. It is required
for DNA replication, because the enzymes that catalyze this process (DNA polymerases) can only add new nucleotides to an existing strand of DNA
*Polymorphic: Occuring in several different forms, in particular with reference to species or genetic variation. 
*Slippage replication/replication slippage/slipped-strand mispairing: is a form of mutation that leads to either a trinucleotide or dinucleotide
expansion or contraction during DNA replication (for more info see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite)
