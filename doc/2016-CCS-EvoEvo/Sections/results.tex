\subsection{ECHO Model Network Analysis. }

From the different ecological interactions implemented in ECHO, no significant modular structure was found. However, the conditions of mutualism, with saturated and sigmoid lichenization functions showed statistically significant nestedness values. The z-score determines how different our measured value is from the distribution calculated from the randomized networks (null model), and the percentile tells us the percentage of random network distributions that have values inferior to the one obtained from our network. We did not retrieve any nestedness value higher than 0.5. We obtained a nestedness value of 0.18 (the maximum nestedness is 1). Although our value of 0.18 is significantly more nested than the null models, we cannot say definitively that it is a nested network. Regarding the modularity metric, no case was found to be statistically significant. The mean modularity of the randomized networks was practically equal to the one observed in our network.
