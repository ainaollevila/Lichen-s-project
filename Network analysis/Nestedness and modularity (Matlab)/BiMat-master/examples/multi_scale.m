%% Multi-Scale Statistics
% An ecological network may look modular or nested depending on the scale
% at which it is observed 
% (see <http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v7/n3/abs/ismej2012135a.html Flores et al
% 2013> for an example). For example, if we focus at the global scale
% of the network we may infer that the network is modular and not nested.
% However, if we go to the inner community modules (after performing one of the
% modularity algorithms) we may discover that they are actually nested.
% Performing this kind of analysis may be exhausting, specially if nothing
% is to be found. However, |BiMat| provides the tools for performing a
% first exploratory analysis that we call Multi-scale Statistics.
%
% Under this kind of analysis, |BiMat| first find what are the modular
% structure of the network. Once we found what are the modules, |BiMat|
% treat them as independent networks by performing a meta-statistics
% analsyis on them. Finally, if the user have available data about node
% classification, this data can be used by |BiMat| to analyze if the
% modular structure may be explained by node classification (i.e. nodes from
% the same class may be clustered inside the same module). In order to do
% that |BiMat| can make use of two kind of diversity indexes that can be applied to
% row and/or column modules:
%
% * *Simpson's Index of Diversity* : @1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^c n_i (n_i -1)}{N (N-1)}@ 
% * *Shannon's Index of Diversity*: @-\sum_{i=1}^c \frac{n_i}{N} \log \frac{n_i}{N}@
%
% where (assuming it will be used on the row species) @c@ is the number of modules,
% @n_i@ the number of row species
% belonging to module @i@, and @N@ the number of row species.
%% Example: Moebus Meta-scale analysis
% In this example we will describe how to perform this kind of statistical
% analysis in a network that is large enough. This network is composed
% of 286 bacteria vs 215 phages that represents the largest cross-infection
% study to date. The phages and bacteria
% strains were collected across multiple geographical locations across the
% Atlantic ocean (and we will use this locations as node classes).
% We will see that this network is modular at the global scale (entire
% network) but the modules are inded nested.

% <html><h3>Creating the Bipartite object</h3></html>
%
% We need to start by creating our |Bipartite| object
load moebus_data.mat;
%%
% The loaded data contains the bipartite adjacency matrix of the Moebus and
% Nattkemper study, where 1's and 2's in the matrix represent either clear
% or turbid lysis spots. It also contains the labels for both bacteria and
% phages and their geographical location (classes) from which they were isolated 
% across the Atlantic Ocean.
bp = Bipartite(moebus.weight_matrix);    % Create the main object
bp.row_labels = moebus.bacteria_labels;  % Updating node labels
bp.col_labels = moebus.phage_labels;     
bp.row_class = moebus.bacteria_stations;   % Updating node ids
bp.col_class = moebus.phage_stations;
%%%
% We can print the general properties of the network with:
bp.printer.PrintGeneralProperties();

% <html><h3>Performing some modularity and nestedness analysis</h3></html>
%
% We can now perform the standard modularity and nestedness calculation.
% For modularity:
bp.community = LeadingEigenvector(bp.matrix);
% The next flag is exclusive of Newman Algorithm and what it does is to
% performn a final tuning after each sub-division (see Newman 2006). 
bp.community.DoKernighanLinTunning = true; % Default value
%%%
% We need to calculate the modularity explicitly by calling:
bp.community.Detect();
%%
% For nestedness
%Just apply the default (which is NODF)
bp.nestedness.Detect();

% <html><h3>Plotting the matrix</h3></html>
%
% Plotting in Matrix Layout
% You can print the layout of the original, nestedness and modular sorting.
% If you matrix is weighted in a categorical way using integers
% (0,1,2...) you can visualize a different color for each
% interaction (as in this case), but we will turn off this default value:
figure(1);
%Matlab command to change the figure window;
set(gcf,'Position',[0, 72, 1835, 922]); 
bp.plotter.use_type_interaction = false; % TURN OFF color matrix cells by weights
bp.plotter.use_labels = false; % plot the node labels
bp.plotter.back_color = [192, 192, 192]/255; % low gray
%After changing all the format we finally can call the plotting functions.

%Original sorting
subplot(1,3,1);
bp.plotter.PlotMatrix(); 
xlabel('Original Sorting','fontsize',26);

% Nestedness sorting;
subplot(1,3,2);
bp.plotter.use_isocline = true; %The NTC isocline will be plotted.
bp.plotter.isocline_color = 'red'; %Decide the color of the isocline.
bp.plotter.PlotNestedMatrix();

% <html><h3>Multi-scale part</h3></html>
%
% It is evident that the entire network is modular (a result 
% confirmed by the use of the modularity significance detection suite). 
% Of relevance here is that
% internal nodes seems to have nested structure, e.g.,
% there is triangular pattern with most of the links above the
% isocline. Hence, the Moebus network may have multi-scale structure properties
% (indeed, this was already demonstrated in <http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v7/n3/abs/ismej2012135a.html Flores et al 2013>)). 
% Using BiMAT, we can evaluate the internal structure of modules.
% For example, to evaluate nestedness,
% |BiMat| makes use of the |InternalStatistics| class 
% by treating each of the modules independent networks:
%Focus on the first 15 modules
bp.internal_statistics.idx_to_focus_on = 1:15;
%Perform a default internal analysis
bp.internal_statistics.TestInternalModules();
bp.internal_statistics.meta_statistics...
             .plotter.PlotNestednessValues();
bp.internal_statistics.meta_statistics...
             .plotter.PlotNestedMatrices();
%%
% The |meta_statistics| property is an
% instance of the class |MetaStatistics|, which translates to be able to use any of the methods
% inside |MetaStatistics| (including its property |plotter|) in the internal modules.
% This feature is a reflection of the use of OOP in developing |BiMat|.
% 
% Finally, another multi-scale analysis that |BiMat| can perform is to quantify if a relationship exists
% between node labels and module distribution.  This feature is of
% particular use when the node information is available, e.g., with respect
% to their study origin or other categorical (i.e,. non-metric) feature.
% If there is a perfect correlation between label and module,
% then every node inside the same module will share the same label.
% If there is no relationship, then node labels in a module should be randomly
% distributed.
% |BiMat| makes use of both Shannon's and Simpson's indexes to analyze the label
% variation inside and between modules.
% Hence, the heterogeneity of label indices is measured within each module.  Then,
% node labels are randomly swapped, generating
% an ensemble from which to compare the measured correlation. The next
% lines will show how to perform this with analysis for the column (phage)
% nodes:
% Given the labeling this method calculates the
% diversity index of the labeling inside each module and compare it with
% random permutations of the labeling across the matrix.
%Using the labeling of bp and 1000 random permutations
bp.internal_statistics.TestDiversityColumns( ...
    1000,moebus.phage_stations,@Diversity.SHANNON_INDEX); 
%Print the information of column diversity
bp.printer.PrintColumnModuleDiversity();
