# BiMat

BiMat is a MATLAB library whose main function is the analysis of modularity
and nestedness in bipartite ecological networks. Its main features are:

* Modularity and nestedness calculation.
* Diversity calculation using Shannon and Simpson's indexes.
* Different null models for the creation of random bipartite networks.
* Statistics of the network.
* Internal statistics of the modules (multi-scale analysis).
* Group statistical analysis (analysis of many networks).
* Parallel processing for improving the speed during a statistical analysis.
* Plotting in matrix or graph layouts.
